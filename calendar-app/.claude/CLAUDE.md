## Workflow 

1. First think through the problem, read the code base and write a plan in tasks/todo.md file. 
2. The plan should be a checklist of todo items
3. Check with me before starting work, letting me verify the plan before proceeding
4. Complete the todo list one by one, marking them off as you go
5. At every step, give me a high level explanation of what you changed.
6. Keep every change simple and minimal. Avoid big rewrites.
7. At the end, add a review section in todo.md summarizing the changes.
8. Go through the code you just wrote and confirm it follows security best practices. Check that no tokens or other sensitive data is left in the frontend, and that there are no vulnerabilities an attacker could exploit.
